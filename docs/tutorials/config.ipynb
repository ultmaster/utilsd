    "One of the key features provided by utilsd is to connect pricipled configs of `configclass` (`dataclass` essentially), with declarative languages (e.g., JSON/YAML), and concrete objects that are to configure. This tutorial is a step-by-step walkthrough of the most important features `utilsd.config` is capable of. In the end of this tutorial, we will show several reasons why you should use `utilsd.config` over other similar tools."
